# Abstract

In this poster we plan to present preliminary results from a local jurisdictional website coding process that will eventually cover all fifty states plus the District of Columbia. We code each website, if the jurisdiction has one, for a range of election administration outcomes. The process is similar to that for the EPI at the state level. It includes many more indicators and begins the process of allowing for a systematic examination of whether rurality affects the quality of services offered on the website. The poster will present the coding design, initial findings, and additional details for researchers who may intend to use the data once the project is complete.

# Motivation

Our goal is to both collect data for all election jurisdictions and determine to what degree rurality impacts online accessibility. The data are all available on the project Github, and we plan to expand the coding in the future.

# Progress

So far we have fully coded 34 states, which amounts to about 2,102 counties. Coding continues and will resume in earnest once the summer term begins. Coders are being trained for consistency and collaborate to adjudicate any diagreement or challenging cases. 

# Defining Rural

There are many definitions of rural and little agreement across disciplines and government agencies on exactly what makes a location rural. Given this issue, we fully expect that there may be some disagreement on whether specific counties are urban or rural. For our purposes we are using the Rural-Urbam continuum codes from the USDA ERS. "The 2013 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes form a classification scheme that distinguishes metropolitan counties by the population size of their metro area, and nonmetropolitan counties by degree of urbanization and adjacency to a metro area." Counties are coded on 1-9 scale where one is the most urban and 9 is the most rural. Few reliable scales of rurality exist below the county level. This create particular challenges for election jurisdictions that operate at the sub-county level.
